## Case Study Questions - Ingredient Optimisation

1. What are the standard ingredients for each pizza?

2. What was the most commonly added extra?

3. What was the most common exclusion?

## Solutions:

Let's collaborate on running the queries using PostgreSQL on [Ingredient Optimization - DB Fiddle](https://www.db-fiddle.com/f/4w3obagYSc9o1FiZZ65cns/31). It'll be fantastic to team up and tackle the questions together!!

### 1. What are the standard ingredients for each pizza?

```sql
SELECT   pn.pizza_id, pn.pizza_name, pt.topping_id, pt.topping_name
FROM     pizza_runner.pizza_names pn JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_recipes pr USING(pizza_id)
                                     JOIN LATERAL unnest(string_to_array(pr.toppings, ',')::INTEGER[]) AS t(topping_id) ON true
                                     JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_toppings pt ON pt.topping_id = t.topping_id
ORDER BY 1
```

**Explanation:**

LATERAL JOIN with `unnest`:

1. **string_to_array(pr.toppings, ',')::INTEGER[]**: Converts the comma-separated string of topping IDs into an array of integers.

2. **unnest(...) AS t(topping_id)**: Expands this array into a set of rows, with each row representing an individual topping ID. This is done through a lateral join, which allows each row from pizza_recipes to be joined to multiple rows produced by unnest.

3. The **LATERAL** keyword is crucial here because it allows the unnest function to be applied to each row from the preceding pizza_recipes table, effectively "flattening" the list of toppings into individual rows.

4. The **ON true** condition for the lateral join is a formality in this context, as the unnest operation generates the rows to be joined without needing a specific condition.

#### Result set:

| pizza_id | pizza_name | topping_id | topping_name |
| -------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| 1        | Meatlovers | 2          | BBQ Sauce    |
| 1        | Meatlovers | 8          | Pepperoni    |
| 1        | Meatlovers | 4          | Cheese       |
| 1        | Meatlovers | 10         | Salami       |
| 1        | Meatlovers | 5          | Chicken      |
| 1        | Meatlovers | 1          | Bacon        |
| 1        | Meatlovers | 6          | Mushrooms    |
| 1        | Meatlovers | 3          | Beef         |
| 2        | Vegetarian | 12         | Tomato Sauce |
| 2        | Vegetarian | 4          | Cheese       |
| 2        | Vegetarian | 6          | Mushrooms    |
| 2        | Vegetarian | 7          | Onions       |
| 2        | Vegetarian | 9          | Peppers      |
| 2        | Vegetarian | 11         | Tomatoes     |

### 2. What was the most commonly added extra?

```sql
WITH extras_expanded AS (
  SELECT unnest(string_to_array(extras, ',')::INTEGER[]) AS extra_id
  FROM   temp_customer_orders
  WHERE  extras IS NOT NULL AND extras <> ''
)
,counted_extras AS (
  SELECT   extra_id, COUNT(*) AS frequency
  FROM     extras_expanded
  GROUP BY 1
  ORDER BY 2 DESC
)
SELECT   pt.topping_name, ce.frequency
FROM     counted_extras ce JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_toppings pt ON ce.extra_id = pt.topping_id
ORDER BY 2 DESC
-- LIMIT 1
```

#### Result set:

| topping_name | frequency |
| ------------ | --------- |
| Bacon        | 4         |
| Cheese       | 1         |
| Chicken      | 1         |

### 3. What was the most common exclusion?

```sql
WITH exclusions_expanded AS (
  SELECT unnest(string_to_array(exclusions, ',')::INTEGER[]) AS exclusion_id
  FROM   temp_customer_orders
  WHERE  exclusions IS NOT NULL AND exclusions <> '' AND exclusions <> 'null'
)
, counted_exclusions AS (
  SELECT   exclusion_id, COUNT(*) AS frequency
  FROM     exclusions_expanded
  GROUP BY 1
  ORDER BY 2 DESC
)
SELECT   pt.topping_name, ce.frequency
FROM     counted_exclusions ce JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_toppings pt ON ce.exclusion_id = pt.topping_id
ORDER BY 2 DESC
-- LIMIT 1;
```

#### Result set:

| topping_name | frequency |
| ------------ | --------- |
| Cheese       | 4         |
| BBQ Sauce    | 1         |
| Mushrooms    | 1         |
